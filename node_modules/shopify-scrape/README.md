Once this package is installed do the following:

1. Require the package. Something like, `const scrape = require("shopify-scrape");`
2. Call the function, and pass in an array of strings as the argument. Each strong should be the `products.json` file of a Shopify collection

Alltogether, it should look like this

`const scrape = require("shopify-scrape");` 

`let urlArray = ['https://negativeunderwear.com/collections/bras/products.json']`

`scrape(urlArray)`

Enjoy!
